# Diamond-Images-AutoEncode

## 1. Project Description

This project aims to develop an **AutoEncoder** model to generate images accurately. Our approach involves training an  AutoEncoder model from scratch on the **Diamond Images dataset**.

## 4. Pre-processing

in this phase I:

* Resize my image to 64x64
* Do normalization on images by dividing each image by 255.0
* reshape images into 64 x 64 x 1
* Split my dataset into 80% for training, 20% for testing


## 5. ðŸ§  Model Architecture

This autoencoder model compresses grayscale diamond images into a latent representation and reconstructs them back to their original form. It consists of:

**1. Encoder**

Input: Grayscale images (img_size, img_size, 1).
Conv2D Layers: Extract spatial features with filters of sizes 32, 64, and 128, using ReLU activation.
MaxPooling: Reduces spatial dimensions progressively.

**2. Bottleneck**
Encodes essential image features into a compact representation.

**3. Decoder**

Conv2DTranspose Layers: Reconstruct features with filters of sizes 128, 64, and 32.
UpSampling: Restores the image to its original dimensions.
Output: Single Conv2DTranspose layer with sigmoid activation for pixel values in [0, 1].


## 6. ðŸ“Š Results

The autoencoder successfully reconstructed the grayscale diamond images, demonstrating its ability to compress and reconstruct visual information.
